## Openbox Config Files

#### Fun Fact 
I learned how to rice openbox while I should have either been writing an essay, or doing my job. Or both. I had originally set out to make a Raspberry Pi that looked and acted like Windows 10, to give to my parents, because it'll probably outpace the old Gateway that they have. But gnome did not like me or something because it was crazy slow (still looking into that), so I just used openbox, and screwed around. Anyways. Yeah.

Have fun. Uhh, sharing is caring, and thus this is free to share, but only with care.

(Also along with an exact copy of the license file. Also if you make any changes send them back, or whatever; I don't github much. I'll figure it out if I get a notification)
